Results and feedback on the questionnaires were shown on a personal online page to reveal participants' progress. The other study consisted of preconception lifestyle advice on diet (advice to follow traditional medicine-oriented diet) and general healthy lifestyle recommendations according to Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM) sources, provided through a face-to-face (F2F) consult, in combination with a training guidance text and telegram group discussion (Alibeigi 2020).
