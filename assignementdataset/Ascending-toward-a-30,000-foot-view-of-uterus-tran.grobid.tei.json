( 4) provided important contributions to the UTx literature by describing complete long-term outcomes from their initial trial.As a summary of their data, 7 of 9 transplants had return of menses within 2 months, all 7 patients conceived at least once, and 6 had at least 1 live birth.Each patient in this study underwent R2 in vitro fertilization cycles before UTx to bank at least 10 (largely cleavage stage) embryos, and cumulatively, 46 embryo transfers were performed, most of which were of day 2 embryos.Of the pregnancies, there was appropriate fetal growth with low-normal uterine blood flow throughout gestation.Although the publication does contain some redundancy with their earlier reports, there are novel elements that should be highlighted.The new data that the investigators included in this study were the longitudinal measures of physical and mental health of the UTx triad (donor, recipient, and child) after delivery.The investigators reported a normal height-weight growth trajectory over the child's first 2 years of life with the mean just below the 50th percentile.Additionally, using validated survey questionnaires, all donor and recipients had no significant changes in their mental and physical component summary scores, nor differences in their anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction scores before and 4 years after UTx.",

(4) are the first to explore this important concern by detailing in their study the recipients' mental and physical health before and 4 years after UTx.Although mental and physical health did not appear to be negatively impacted for recipients in general, 2 recipients had poor mental component summary scores at 4 years after UTx; these 2 had either a poor baseline or were childless with a concomitant poor physical component summary score.In addition, patients who also had higher anxiety and depression scores 4 years after UTx were those who had multiple pregnancy failures.This underscores an important subgroup of the UTx population that may be at increased risk for poorer mental health outcomes, and for whom additional support can be anticipated.",
