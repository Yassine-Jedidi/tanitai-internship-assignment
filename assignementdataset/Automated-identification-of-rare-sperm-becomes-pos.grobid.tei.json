( 4) demonstrated this automation in their study; the investigators used a machine learning algorithm to detect rare sperm in microscopic testicular sperm extraction samples from men with NOA using bright-field microscopy.The investigators trained their convolutional neural network using bright-field images paired with fluorescenttagged sperm images to establish the ground truth before algorithm validation.Overall, the algorithm had 95.8% sensitivity, with a 91% positive predictive value.Lee et al. ( 4) demonstrated the ingenious use of machine learning technology to provide an additional tool for laboratory personnel while searching for sperms in men with NOA.",
