Busnelli et al. (3) attempted to expand upon these paternal risk factors by exploring a plausible cause of RPL: male human papilloma virus (HPV) sperm infection.",

( 3) provide, at the very least, another reason to support the broader campaign to eliminate or treat high-risk HPV strains through vaccination.Furthermore, reproductive urologists are uniquely positioned to recommend HPV vaccination in young men presenting for fertility care, and we should be familiar with guideline recommendations and emerging research in this area.",
