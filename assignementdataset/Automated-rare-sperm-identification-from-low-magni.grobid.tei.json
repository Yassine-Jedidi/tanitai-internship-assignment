For weight initialization, instead of a regular normal distribution used by the U-Net, we used a truncated normal distribution to avoid rare outlier weights but kept the standard deviation of ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2=N p , in which N is the number of input units in the weight tensor.The energy function is computed pixel-wise using the two-class sigmoid function rather than the multiclass softmax function.The network uses a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function instead of an unweighted version, as well as the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01.This loss function increases the log loss of incorrectly segmenting sperm by the ratio of background to sperm pixels in the entire training data set.The output segmentation was binarized into a single-layered 8-bit 256 \u00c2 256-pixel image for postprocessing.",
