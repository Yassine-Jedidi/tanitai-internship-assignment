'' In the last 20 years, the landscape of reproductive endocrine infertility (REI) has undergone an enormous transition.Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have become the mainstay of many practices, and there are those within the specialty that question the role of reproductive surgery given the success rates of ART (2) .Conversely, there are many others in the field who argue that reproductive surgery continues to be innovative and remains an important component of treating the infertile couple and women of childbearing age, especially those with fibroids, symptomatic endometriosis, hydrosalpinges, ovarian cysts, intrauterine adhesions, and m\u20ac ullerian anomalies (3).",
