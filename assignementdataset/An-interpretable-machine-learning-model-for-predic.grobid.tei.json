                "text": "Unstandardized model coefficients allow for direct interpretability on how one additional follicle of any given size changes the predicted MII outcome.For example, as shown in Supplemental Table 3 , a single follicle of size 11-13 mm contributes 0.52 oocytes for the trigger today model and 0.71 oocytes for the trigger tomorrow model.For a patient with 10 follicles of size 11-13 mm, this represents an additional 1.9 MII oocytes that could be obtained from this follicle group by waiting one additional day before trigger.Of course, this must be balanced against the potential loss of MII oocytes from other follicles that are growing too large.As shown in Supplemental Table 3 , a single follicle of size 16-17 mm contributes 0.69 oocytes for the trigger today model and 0.57 oocytes for the trigger tomorrow model.For a patient with 10 follicles of size 16-17 mm, this represents 1.2 fewer MII oocytes that would be obtained from this follicle group by waiting another day.The full linear regression model weighs the relative contributions of each follicle group and provides an objective assessment of the potential benefit or harm of waiting another day before the trigger.In developing our model, we explored different outcomes such as oocytes retrieved, MII oocytes, 2PNs, and usable blastocysts.Although all of these outcomes are important, the goal of a successful IVF cycle is of course a healthy live birth.It was not possible with our data to calculate accurate cumulative live birth rates, but our estimates showed that the oocytes retrieved, MII oocytes, and 2PNs all had a positive correlation with live birth outcomes, agreeing with previous studies (11) .However, there may be a plateau for higher responders, which has been suggested in other studies (12, 13) .We decided to use MII oocytes as our primary outcome, because the number of mature oocytes is a direct outcome of ovarian stimulation, whereas other outcomes such as 2PNs and blastocysts depend on the quality of sperm and laboratory procedures.We note that most of our data came from intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles in which MII oocytes can be most accurately counted.However, we also included conventional IVF cycles if the EMR had an entry for MII oocytes, as we found that excluding conventional IVF cycles had no meaningful impact on our model performance, improving model accuracy by less than 1%.",
