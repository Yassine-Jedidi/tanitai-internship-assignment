(39) characterized the epigenome in granulosa cells and leukocytes in women with and without diminished ovarian reserve, noting that ovarian reserve status was not reflected in leukocyte epigenetic profile, even as the follicular cells had distinctive epigenetic patterns consistent with aging.Along similar lines, Morin et al.
