These tests detect human serum/</td></tr><tr><td>plasma antibodies to Treponema pallidum by means of an indirect</td></tr><tr><td>hemagglutination method. The results of these tests are given in</td></tr><tr><td>a dichotomy method, being \"positive\" or \"negative\" the possible</td></tr><tr><td>results (Naidu 2012).</td></tr><tr><td>Currently, there are two common approaches to the diagnosis</td></tr><tr><td>of syphilis using serological tests: the traditional algorithm and</td></tr><tr><td>the reverse algorithm. The CDC recommends the traditional</td></tr><tr><td>algorithm (CDC 2014). This algorithm begins the screening with</td></tr><tr><td>a non-treponemal test and confirms a positive result with a</td></tr><tr><td>treponemal test (CDC 2014; PAHO 2015; WHO 2003). However,</td></tr><tr><td>the treponemal-based tests remain positive for life and cannot</td></tr><tr><td>distinguish between recent, active infection and previously treated</td></tr><tr><td>or old, non-contagious infection (PAHO 2015). A reverse testing</td></tr><tr><td>algorithm utilises a treponemal primary screening assay followed</td></tr><tr><td>by a non-treponemal test if the primary treponemal assay is</td></tr><tr><td>positive. If the secondary, non-treponemal test is reactive, then</td></tr><tr><td>active syphilis is confirmed (CDC 2008). In the literature, it is</td></tr><tr><td>considered as active syphilis if a positive treponemal test and a non-</td></tr><tr><td>treponemal test is reactive with di erent thresholds, with a non-</td></tr><tr><td>treponemal test at any titre, more than two dilutions or more than</td></tr><tr><td>four dilutions (Kay 2014).</td></tr><tr><td>The presence of a hard chancre in genitals is suggestive of</td></tr><tr><td>syphilis, and its treatment is considered in the syndromic approach</td></tr><tr><td>of genital ulcers, because the treponemal test and the non-</td></tr><tr><td>treponemal test initially can both be negative. The reactive syphilis</td></tr><tr><td>test in combination with a typical clinical sign of syphilis such a</td></tr><tr><td>chancre, skin ulcer, or rash is highly suggestive of the disease (PAHO</td></tr><tr><td>2015). In the absence of symptoms, a combination of both reactive</td></tr><tr><td>non-treponemal and treponemal test indicates the possibility of</td></tr><tr><td>contagious syphilis infection, and</td></tr><tr><td>supports the need for treatment of the individual and any sex</td></tr><tr><td>partners (PAHO 2015).</td></tr><tr><td>The treponemal tests are expensive, laboratory-based, require a</td></tr><tr><td>continuous supply of electricity, reagents and trained sta , and</td></tr><tr><td>are rarely available outside of reference laboratories. (Peeling</td></tr><tr><td>2004) As a result in many countries, treatment is based on</td></tr><tr><td>non-treponemal tests results, which are cheaper and have more</td></tr><tr><td>availability, leading to over-</td></tr><tr><td>compared with dark-field confirmed cases</td></tr><tr><td>(Creegan 2007)), secondary syphilis 100%, latent syphilis 96%</td></tr><tr><td>to 98%, late syphilis 71% to 73%; specificity 98% in all stages,</td></tr><tr><td>compared with Treponema pallidum Haemagglutination (TPHA)</td></tr><tr><td>test (Naidu 2012), and the potential for false-negative results</td></tr><tr><td>due to prozone phenomenon (Liu 2014).
