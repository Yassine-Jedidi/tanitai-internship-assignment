(1) have highlighted the variance in the defining and reporting of outcomes for ectopic pregnancy research.This is compounded by the fact that there can be ambiguity in its clinical presentation and management.Classically, an ectopic pregnancy could be diagnosed by a positive b-human chorionic gonadotropin level and a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) showing a round anechoic adnexal structure outlined by an echogenic ringthe ''bagel sign.''What about the patient with vaginal spotting and an early positive home pregnancy test result who has been trying to conceive for nearly a year and now has a TVUS with not only no bagel sign but also no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)?A pregnancy of unknown location puts the patient at a crossroad in terms of management because the underlying diagnosis could be one of several things: an early normal intrauterine pregnancy (that could be interrupted by ectopic pregnancy treatment), a resolving miscarriage, or a small ectopic pregnancy that is yet to become visible (but could still cause life-threatening hemorrhage at any size); plateauing values over several days of serial b-human chorionic gonadotropin monitoring may lead a provider to presumptively treat a pregnancy as an ectopic pregnancy, even in the absence of definitive TVUS findings.The significant variation in the presentation of these ectopic pregnancy examples underscores some of the difficulties in treating and studying such abnormal pregnancies; nevertheless what is very clearly known is the potential for high morbidity and even mortality in ectopic pregnancy cases.Thus, Chong et al. (1) emphasized an aim of generating a core set of universal outcome measures that can be used regardless of the scenario in which the ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed.In an uncertain clinical scenario, COSs facilitate reflection on the effectiveness of treatment outcomes in a more structured way to better inform individualized, risk-minimizing patient care and future studies.",

( 1) is an excellent foundation upon which future efforts can be made to identify and reconcile the values of even more diverse stakeholders.However, to be effective, even a perfectly curated COS must overcome the challenge of implementation.The study by Chong et al. ( 1) is strengthened by the investigators' rigorously structured consensus methodology and careful attention to defining the final core outcomes to help reproducibility and optimize application; they also made efforts to diversify their steering committees and stakeholders to yield generalizable, meaningful outcomes.Their results are publicly available in the expanding Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative database.In certain fields, uptake of COSs has been very successful; for instance, a study using the clinical trials registry showed that uptake of the rheumatoid arthritis COS has increased over time, now with more than 80% of trials in this field reporting data on the full set (3).Yet, despite readily available COSs in a growing range of health areas, several studies have demonstrated that there is still wide variation in uptake, particularly for patientreported outcomes (4, 5) .One study surveyed trialists, revealing that few had ever received education about COSs or been involved in COS development; most of them cited a lack of awareness of existing COSs, preference for trialspecific outcomes, or concerns about executing COS measurement as barriers to their inclusion in trials (4) .A study of patient-reported outcomes highlighted the impracticality of some lengthy patient questionnaires and the limited scope of disease-specific variables as obstacles to uptake (5) .Perhaps by standardizing variables that can be readily collected within the usual clinical workflow, COS uptake can be made more practical to guide clinical decision making in real time and reduce the collection burden on trialists.",
