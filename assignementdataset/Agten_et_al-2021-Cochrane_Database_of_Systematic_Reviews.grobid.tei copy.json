The</td></tr><tr><td>authors did not report any conflicts of interest.</td></tr><tr><td>In Geerts 1996, women received either an ultrasound examination</td></tr><tr><td>between 18 and 24 weeks, or routine antenatal care with selective</td></tr><tr><td>scans.

Information on funding sources or declarations of interest</td></tr><tr><td>were not reported.</td></tr><tr><td>The Goldenberg 2018 trial was a cluster-randomised trial in low</td></tr><tr><td>and middle-income countries. It involved a complex intervention</td></tr><tr><td>that included training health workers (nurses, midwives and clinical</td></tr><tr><td>o icers) to perform an ultrasound at 16 to 22 and 32 to 36 weeks'</td></tr><tr><td>gestation in the intervention group. The comparator was routine</td></tr><tr><td>care. There was such a high level of scanning in the comparison</td></tr><tr><td>group that the review authors decided the trial would belong to</td></tr><tr><td>the routine ultrasound versus selective ultrasound comparison.</td></tr><tr><td>However, as the trial involved a complex intervention, not only</td></tr><tr><td>scanning the women, but also training health care workers and</td></tr><tr><td>referring women for complications, we decided to keep Goldenberg</td></tr><tr><td>2018 in its own comparison. Goldenberg 2018 took place from July</td></tr><tr><td>2014 to May 2016 and was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute</td></tr><tr><td>of Child Health.
